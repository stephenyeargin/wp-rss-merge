WordPress RSS Merge Plugin
=============================================================================================

This plugin allows you to have a sidebar widget that pulls from multiple RSS feeds to create a bulleted list of links. It is ideal for cases where you want to aggregate blog posts or other content from several sources. It uses the WordPress widget framework, so your theme will need to support dynamic sidebars (the WordPress construct for widgets) in order to display the content.

Installation:
-------------

# Copy the `wp-rss-merge` folder to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory, so that your final path looks like `wp-content/plugins/wp-rss-merge/`
# Activate the plugin from the 'Plugins' menu.
# Drag the `Multi-Feed Widget` to a position in your defined sidebars (again, your theme must support dynamic sidebars)
# Configure the feeds and title for your widget
# Style the widget as you so desire

Support:
--------

* Ask a question by filing a support ticket on Github (https://github.com/stephenyeargin/wp-rss-merge/issues)
* Consult the WordPress Codex for specific help with dynamic sidbears
